			</div>
			<div class='row'>
			  <div class='col-sm-6'>
				<p>The process of human development has never been smooth sailing. War will make civilization retrograde, but technological innovation will inevitably bring social progress.</p>
				<p>Peace is the ultimate ideal to be pursued by mankind. This notion is based on an examination of actual individual living conditions, and ultimately a concern for the destiny of human beings, that we are proposing a social ideal beyond geographical boundaries. The construction of any social ideal is based on people's critical reflection on the actual state of their society. Any new social ideal must be imbued with some kind of humanistic care, and it must embody people's hopes for future progressive social development, by one means or another. The value orientation expressed by social ideals must conform to the laws of social development, and the dimension of social ideals must be consistent with the scale of historical development.</p>
				<p>History, like cognition, never begins with a perfect ideal state for mankind. A perfect society, or 'state', is something that can only exist in fantasy; on the contrary, all successive states of history are just temporary stages in the ongoing developmental process of human society, from low to high, as a whole. Class and state are only historical categories, they have not always existed, nor will they exist forever.</p>
			
			</div>
			  <div class='col-sm-6'>
				<p>We believe that with the ongoing development of blockchain technology, human society will experience a major transformation in the form of it’s social organization and reach a higher stage of development. This will namely be a no state-state, a state with a higher form. In this advanced stage of social formation we have seen our individual productivity greatly increased, and all the sources of collective wealth now available through the transgressively developmental nature of cryptocurrency have fully flowed. At this time, we have gone beyond the narrow vision of the traditional class, and wrote on our banner:</p> 
			<p>From Each According To His Ability, To Each According To His Need!</p>
			<p>Blockchain offers a world where there is no war, no class contradictions, only fair nodes! Therefore; we propose the building of a new country, with a divestment from traditional geoeconomics and geopolitics. This is an unprecedented initiative in human history, and we sing for ourselves at the opportunities we can create! The emergence of any new idea will always be questioned and ridiculed, but our response will always be to defend these ideals to the end, while we take these first steps towards a higher social form!</p>
			<p>We are grateful that this era has allowed us to develop blockchain technology. From this point on, our ideals can no longer be dismissed as impossible. We need a peaceful place to pursue truth and love. Let's work together and witness this moment to come!</p>

					<h4>PeaceDao: A Definition</h4>
				  	<p>The concept of PeaceDao consists of three parts: philosophy, law and science. The essence of PeaceDao is to advocate world peace and prevent national conflicts and class struggles. It is to provide post-war devastated people the opportunity to rebuild their homes.</p>
					<p>We will issue tokens after the initial financing is completed, and donors will receive $PeaceDao governance tokens and Medal of Honor NFTs with different rarities, before completing a series of processes to legally establish a country.</p>
					<p>PeaceDao’s vision is to build a real country belonging to the cryptocurrency world that exists within a real-world map, and try to use DAO to govern this country. The seemingly impossible dreams of the past can now be accomplished in the present through the concerted efforts of our cypherpunk community.</p>
					<p>The PeaceDao Refugee Emergency Response Project provides emergency assistance to people fleeing war-torn countries. We plan to build a distributed country by raising ETH to buy multiple lands and islands, and provide these locations to nearby immigrants, and those in need. The newly established country can provide refuge to multiple post-war victims, as well as provide them with job opportunities on the blockchain, and public welfare training to help rebuild their lives. We will also attempt to provide free food, education and scholarships to affected children in any war-torn country.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class='row' id="center">
			 	<div class='col-sm-12'>
				<h4>PeaceDao: Financing</h4>
				<p>PeaceDAO is completely community-led. We plan to raise funds in JuiceBox for a month, and each participant will contribute ETH and receive a corresponding share of the governance token $Peace.</p>
				<p>$Peace will become the token for managing PeaceDAO. Donating 1ETH you will get the recipient a 1,000,000 Token. After the financing is complete, we will generate the corresponding number of Tokens according to the financing amount. All tokens will be 100% distributed back to within the community. The donation time is one month, and there is no upper limit on the donation amount during this period. After the financing is completed, Token $Peace will be generated and issued.</p>

			<div class="row" id="center">
			<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h4>PeaceDao: Country Operating Rules</h4>
						<p>State system: DAO</p>
						<p>Democracy 2.0, governance 2.0.</p>
						<p>Donors will become Congressman, participate in legislation and national governance, and have the right to vote. The president and ministers are elected from amongst the congressmen.</p>
					  <p>Issuing Passports: Joining Peace DAO has no physical restrictions and is global, we can issue you a passport no matter where you live, and you can then participate in the governance of the country.</p>
					<p>More governance rules will be generated in the initiation of proposals and voting, and your votes will ultimately determine the future direction of the country. One small step for voting, one giant leap for civilization, and a truly decentralized state.</p>
					<p>Change the world and make history.</p>			  
				</div>
			</div>


 <div class="row" id="center">
	 <div class="col-sm-12">
		<h4>PeaceDao: Refund Plan</h4>
		<p>If the United Nations does not approve our application, or if the establishment of a virtual country, donation of post-war plans, etc. are not enacted for any reason, we will start the refund process, take a snapshot of the investment address at that time, and everyone will receive a fair refund. Donors can choose to exchange back ETH at the price of 1 million Token=1ETH, or choose to keep the tokens.</p>

	 </div>
 </div>

<div class="row" id="center">
<div class="col-sm-12">
	<h4>PeaceDao: Code Security</h4>
	<p>After the financing and the token issuance is completed, we will start the code security audit of the ERC, which is carried out by a professional security agency. After the first phase of product iteration is completed, we will start the security work of the entire product, including (but not limited to) server security, front-end and back-end code security audits, organizational structure security audits, and logic vulnerability security audits.</p>

				<h4>PeaceDao: Team Members</h4>
				<p>We are a group of peace-loving social workers from the United States, Russia, Ukraine, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Israel. We have war correspondents, media workers, social workers, United Nations volunteers, national civil servants, and the like as a part of our collective.</p>
			<p>We are temporarily anonymous due to the war situation.</p>
			<p>This is the land of freedom and the home of the brave, and we want to subvert the existing economic order.</p>
			<p>What we create is not just a country, but also the hope of humanity! <br> See you at the right time.</p>
